# Python Algo Trading Project

This is a personal algo trading project for MetaTrader5 written in Python.

## How to Run

Start the project by running:
python manual_play.py

## Backtesting

If you haven't run the backtests yet, they will require one full day to complete.  
This is because the `generate_fast()` and `generate_slow()` functions need significant time to process.

Please **do not start the bot** on the first day.  
Wait until the next day to run it with full functionality after the data has been generated.

## Parameters

Main parameters are located in:

config/parameters.py

Note: Some parameters are embedded directly in the function definitions.

## About the Project

- Function descriptions and full documentation are not yet available â€” they will be added in the future.
- This project was created entirely by me, a self-taught programmer and algo trading enthusiast.
- Some existing comments are written in Polish.

## Contribution

You're welcome to test the project and give feedback. Thank you!
